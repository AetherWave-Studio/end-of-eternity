      <h1>About End of Eternity</h1>
      <p>
        End of Eternity is an immersive audio-visual narrative experience under the AetherWave Studio banner,
        blending AI-driven soundscapes with handcrafted storytelling. It is designed to feel like a living,
        breathing world you step into rather than a show you passively consume.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every scene is scored dynamically, with spatialized audio and subtle visual cues that respond to the
        emotional arc of the chapter. This isn’t just a listening session—it’s an encounter.
      </p>
      <p>
        AetherWave Studio’s ethos is simple:
        <strong>AI Music • Human Soul • Immersive Sound.</strong>
        End of Eternity is one of our flagship explorations of that vision.
